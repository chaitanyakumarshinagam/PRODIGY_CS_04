# PRODIGY_CS_04
This is one of my internship task at Prodigy InfoTech. This code is a basic keylogger program written in python using pynput library which asks user for a specified time till the keystrokes are captured. Then the log is saved to a keylogger_log.txt file which can be viewed later. pynput library must be installed prior to running this code.
